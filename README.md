#   Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee turnover trends and predict which employees are likely to leave the company based on various features.
#   Implementation Steps
#   Data Preprocessing
1.  Load and explore the dataset.
2.  Handle missing values and outliers.
3.  Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
#   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1.  Visualizing employee turnover trends.
2.  Analyzing correlations between different features
3.  Identifying key factors affecting employee attrition
#   Machine Learning Modeling
1.  Train various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
2.  Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.  Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved model accuracy.
